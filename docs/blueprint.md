# **App Name**: IssueSnap

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using Supabase for both employee and user roles.
- Location Access: Request and obtain the user's location for complaint context.
- Image Capture: Enable users to capture images using their device camera for problem reporting.
- VLM-Powered Complaint Generation: Send the captured image to a VLM model. The output generated by VLM is stored in a text file and used as a basis for an initial complaint, that the user can then edit. The VLM model uses tool use for making its decisions about what information from the image should be included in the complaint.
- Complaint Submission & Editing: Allow users to review, edit, and submit the AI-generated complaint.
- Complaint Management: Enable employees to view complaints, upload updated images, and mark complaints as resolved.
- Real-time Notifications: Use Supabase real-time functionality for updates on complaint status to both users and employees.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for a sense of trust and efficiency.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), close in hue to the primary, for a clean interface.
- Accent color: Bright coral (#FF7F50) for call-to-action buttons and important alerts.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern and neutral look.
- Use clear, concise icons from a library like 'Lucide' to represent different complaint categories and actions.
- Implement a responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS to ensure usability across devices.
- Use subtle transitions and animations powered by react-spring for feedback, like loading states and confirmation messages.
